---

### Comment Preservation Implementation Issues ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Previous Status**: Critical architectural fix needed for positioning/spacing issues.

**Problem Resolved**: Comment preservation system had three specific positioning issues:
1. `# these` comment (line 9) misplaced - should be directly before `labels:` (line 10)
2. `# this` comment (line 12) should be end-of-line with `includeSelectors: true` - appeared as standalone instead
3. `# whee` comment (line 17) lost blank line spacing before `images:` (line 19)

**Root Cause Analysis**: Initially built separate comment metadata system instead of integrating with existing blank line preservation architecture.

**Resolution Achieved**: The comment preservation implementation now correctly handles all positioning scenarios:
- ✅ Standalone comments properly positioned before their associated lines
- ✅ End-of-line comments correctly preserved with their content lines
- ✅ Blank line spacing maintained around comment blocks
- ✅ Integration with existing blank line preservation system working seamlessly

**Verification**: Tested with `tests/test-data/kustomization.yaml` - all comment positioning issues resolved.

**Technical Implementation**: Unified line preservation approach successfully implemented, eliminating need for parallel comment system.

  - Maintained existing behavior for non-container documents and file output targets
  - **Result**: `kubectl get all -A -o yaml | huml -o /tmp/dir/` now creates separate sequence-prefixed files instead of single container file

- [x] **Container Detection Logic** (Format Processing) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Leveraged existing `_has_items_array()` function for consistent container detection
  - Integration with existing Kubernetes manifest processing workflow
  - Proper handling of source factory metadata for individual items

  - Confirmed generation of sequence-prefixed individual files (e.g., `11-service-*`, `14-deployment-*`, `19-pod-*`)
  - Validated that container wrapper is properly excluded from directory output
  - **Result**: Directory output now identical to multi-document YAML file processing

#### **Container Unwrapping Results Summary**
- **Problem Solved**: `kubectl get all -A -o yaml | huml -o /tmp/dir/` previously created single file, now creates separate sequence-prefixed files
- **Architecture**: Built on existing items array detection and processing logic
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-container documents and file output targets unchanged

3. **immutable-context-pattern** ✅ (already present)
   - ProcessingContext and OutputContext well-designed
   - Extended with computed properties

4. **cli-testing-pattern** ✅ (already present)
   - Format detection helpers already extracted
   - Direct testing without CliRunner
   - Validated existing architecture

### Pattern Evidence

The codebase demonstrated mature understanding of testability patterns:
- CLI helpers (`_looks_like_json`, `_is_json_lines`, etc.) already extracted
- Direct testing approach in `tests/test_cli.py:29-146`
- Frozen dataclasses for configuration
- Clear separation of concerns

This refactoring formalized and extended existing patterns.

## Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Pure Function Extraction**
   - Dramatically improves testability
   - No mocks needed = faster, simpler tests
   - Clear input/output contracts

2. **Numbered Orchestration Steps**
   - Makes main functions self-documenting
   - Clear refactoring boundaries
   - Easier code review

3. **Progressive Refactoring**
   - Start with quick wins (properties)
   - Build momentum with high-impact changes
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Continue Pattern Application**
   - More opportunities exist in `formatting_emitter.py`
   - `represent_formatting_aware_dict` (complexity 13)

2. **Consider Thread-Local State Elimination**
   - Buffer pool and content markers in `dumper.py`
   - Only if parallelization issues arise (low priority)

3. **Feature-Based Test Organization**
   - Current organization adequate for library size
   - Consider if codebase grows significantly

## Session: 2025-10-08 - TODO Improvement #2 Completed to Target

### Task: Simplify dump() Function Complexity

**Priority:** High
**Pattern:** pure-function-extraction-pattern + dataclass-property-pattern
**Location:** `src/yaml_for_humans/dumper.py:296-352`

### Previous State (2025-10-07)

The function was **partially refactored** with 3 helpers extracted:
- Complexity: 12 → 8 (33% reduction)
- Target not met: 5-6 complexity
- Missing: DumpConfig dataclass

### Completed Work (2025-10-08)

#### 1. Created DumpConfig Dataclass ✅

**File:** `src/yaml_for_humans/dumper.py:27-53`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DumpConfig:
    """Configuration for YAML dump operations."""
    preserve_empty_lines: bool = False
    preserve_comments: bool = False
    dumper_class: Optional[Type] = None

    @property
    def needs_formatting(self) -> bool:
        """Check if any formatting preservation is enabled."""
        return self.preserve_empty_lines or self.preserve_comments
```

**Benefits:**
- Encapsulates preservation flags
- Computed property eliminates duplicated logic
- Immutable (frozen) for safety
- Type-safe with Optional[Type]

#### 2. Extracted _setup_formatting_dumper Helper ✅

**File:** `src/yaml_for_humans/dumper.py:258-293`

```python
def _setup_formatting_dumper(config: DumpConfig, dump_kwargs: dict) -> dict:
    """Configure dump kwargs for formatting-aware dumper."""
    # Removes PyYAML-incompatible params
    # Creates preset dumper with preservation flags
    return modified_kwargs
```

**Complexity:** 2
**Pure function:** No side effects, no I/O
**Benefits:**
- Isolates kwargs cleanup logic
- Avoids mutating input dict
- Testable independently

#### 3. Refactored dump() Function ✅

**Changes:**
- Uses DumpConfig instead of raw booleans
- Calls `config.needs_formatting` property (eliminates duplication)
- Delegates to `_setup_formatting_dumper`
- Cleaner control flow with 4 numbered steps

**Before:**
- Duplicated `needs_formatting and dumper_class == FormattingAwareDumper` checks
- Inline kwargs manipulation
- Complexity: 8

**After:**
- Single conditional check using config.needs_formatting
- Clean delegation to helper
- Complexity: 5 ✅

### Complexity Analysis

**Current Complexity (measured 2025-10-08):**

```
_select_dumper                           Complexity:  3
_build_dump_kwargs                       Complexity:  1
_create_preset_dumper                    Complexity:  1
_setup_formatting_dumper                 Complexity:  2  ← NEW
dump                                     Complexity:  5  ← IMPROVED
```

**Comparison to TODO Target:**
- **Original:** 12
- **Partial (2025-10-07):** 8 (33% reduction)
- **Final (2025-10-08):** 5 (58% reduction) ✅
- **Target:** 5-6 ✅ **MET**
- **Grade:** C → A

### Test Coverage

**File:** `tests/test_dump_helpers.py`

#### TestDumpConfig (5 tests)
- `test_needs_formatting_both_false()` - Property returns False when no flags

- `test_needs_formatting_comments_only()` - True with preserve_comments
- `test_needs_formatting_both_true()` - True with both flags
- `test_config_is_frozen()` - Immutability verified
