---

### Comment Preservation Implementation Issues ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Previous Status**: Critical architectural fix needed for positioning/spacing issues.

**Problem Resolved**: Comment preservation system had three specific positioning issues:
1. `# these` comment (line 9) misplaced - should be directly before `labels:` (line 10)
2. `# this` comment (line 12) should be end-of-line with `includeSelectors: true` - appeared as standalone instead
3. `# whee` comment (line 17) lost blank line spacing before `images:` (line 19)

**Root Cause Analysis**: Initially built separate comment metadata system instead of integrating with existing blank line preservation architecture.

**Resolution Achieved**: The comment preservation implementation now correctly handles all positioning scenarios:
- ✅ Standalone comments properly positioned before their associated lines
- ✅ End-of-line comments correctly preserved with their content lines
- ✅ Blank line spacing maintained around comment blocks
- ✅ Integration with existing blank line preservation system working seamlessly

**Verification**: Tested with `tests/test-data/kustomization.yaml` - all comment positioning issues resolved.

**Technical Implementation**: Unified line preservation approach successfully implemented, eliminating need for parallel comment system.

  - Maintained existing behavior for non-container documents and file output targets
  - **Result**: `kubectl get all -A -o yaml | huml -o /tmp/dir/` now creates separate sequence-prefixed files instead of single container file

- [x] **Container Detection Logic** (Format Processing) ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Leveraged existing `_has_items_array()` function for consistent container detection
  - Integration with existing Kubernetes manifest processing workflow
  - Proper handling of source factory metadata for individual items

  - Confirmed generation of sequence-prefixed individual files (e.g., `11-service-*`, `14-deployment-*`, `19-pod-*`)
  - Validated that container wrapper is properly excluded from directory output
  - **Result**: Directory output now identical to multi-document YAML file processing

#### **Container Unwrapping Results Summary**
- **Problem Solved**: `kubectl get all -A -o yaml | huml -o /tmp/dir/` previously created single file, now creates separate sequence-prefixed files
- **Architecture**: Built on existing items array detection and processing logic
- **Backward Compatibility**: Non-container documents and file output targets unchanged

3. **immutable-context-pattern** ✅ (already present)
   - ProcessingContext and OutputContext well-designed
   - Extended with computed properties

4. **cli-testing-pattern** ✅ (already present)
   - Format detection helpers already extracted
   - Direct testing without CliRunner
   - Validated existing architecture

### Pattern Evidence

The codebase demonstrated mature understanding of testability patterns:
- CLI helpers (`_looks_like_json`, `_is_json_lines`, etc.) already extracted
- Direct testing approach in `tests/test_cli.py:29-146`
- Frozen dataclasses for configuration
- Clear separation of concerns

This refactoring formalized and extended existing patterns.

## Key Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Pure Function Extraction**
   - Dramatically improves testability
   - No mocks needed = faster, simpler tests
   - Clear input/output contracts

2. **Numbered Orchestration Steps**
   - Makes main functions self-documenting
   - Clear refactoring boundaries
   - Easier code review

3. **Progressive Refactoring**
   - Start with quick wins (properties)
   - Build momentum with high-impact changes
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

### Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Continue Pattern Application**
   - More opportunities exist in `formatting_emitter.py`
   - `represent_formatting_aware_dict` (complexity 13)

2. **Consider Thread-Local State Elimination**
   - Buffer pool and content markers in `dumper.py`
   - Only if parallelization issues arise (low priority)

3. **Feature-Based Test Organization**
   - Current organization adequate for library size
   - Consider if codebase grows significantly

## Validation

All improvements validated through:
1. ✅ Complexity measurement (AST-based analysis)
2. ✅ Test execution (all 230 tests passing)
3. ✅ Backward compatibility (existing tests unchanged)
4. ✅ Pattern conformance (brain/ patterns applied correctly)
